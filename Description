The game is called BubblePop. In this
game, a number of bubbles are randomly displayed on an iOS device screen. 
A player pops a bubble by touching the bubble, and every time they pop a bubble they earn a certain number of
points. 
Bubbles come in five colours: red, pink, green, blue and black. Each colour corresponds
to a specific number of points and has a specific probability of appearance. 
All bubbles appear on the screen briefly. A player needs to pop as many bubbles as possible within a certain timeframe, default to 60 seconds, to get high scores. 
Note that, if a player pops two or more bubbles of the same colour consecutively, they earn 1.5 times the points for the additional bubbles they pop. Finally, game scores are saved and a high scoreboard is displayed after a game run is finished.
